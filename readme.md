### Description

This is an application that displays a dashboard for managing tickets. The application uses React as a frontend framework and Material-UI as a component library.

The application displays charts that show information about open and ongoing tickets, as well as a table with ticket details. Additionally, skeleton elements are included to enhance the user experience while the information is loading.

### Installation

Usage

Once the application is running, you will be able to see the dashboard with information about the tickets. The charts display information about open and ongoing tickets, and the table displays details about the tickets, such as their status, creation date, and assignment.

The application also includes skeleton elements that display an animation while the application information is loading. This enhances the user experience and prevents the user from becoming frustrated by the lack of response.
